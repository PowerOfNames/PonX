# Ponvox
PowerOfNames Voxel-Engine

This is a openGL learning project of mine with the goal to create my own little voxel based engine.
I follow the openGl/Game-engine series from TheCherno on youtube and most of the current engine code will be fairly similiar to his "Hazel"-engine, up to the point I concentrate on making the voxel-renderer.



I'm really grateful for his effords making such great work on youtube and showing people how to come up with such a complex and creative topic.
